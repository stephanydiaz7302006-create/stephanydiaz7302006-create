This website is a single-page layout: 
Header: The header contains who the website belongs to 
About me: Its information about me and who I am 
Education: What grade I'm in and my major 
School: The school I go to 
Project: There is project 1 and 2

I decided to do a single page because all the content is on a page. This gives the focus to find all the content without navigating away from the page. This gives the experience simple and interesting. This shows that it makes the website faster and puts the information in one place.I decided to organize the content that shows the clear journey through the page. The first thing I did was my introduction of who I am and continued from there.
